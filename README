ActionCoffee is a little language that compiles into ActionScript.

Install Node.js, and then the CoffeeScript compiler:
sudo bin/cake install

Or, if you have the Node Package Manager installed:
npm install -g coffee-script
(Leave off the -g if you don't wish to install globally.)

Execute a script:
coffee /path/to/script.coffee

Compile a script:
coffee -c /path/to/script.coffee
